# Image classification using keras

In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of developing an ML model for image classification in Keras.

If you have an understanding of basic ML concepts like how neural networks and CNN works and the different layers of CNN,
This will probably a piece of cake.

Let's cut to the chase. 

# Packages

We'll be using tensorflow and keras for building our deep learning model. 

1. Tensorflow - ML library developed by google
2. Keras - It is like Python and C. Keras is a high level framework we can use to build NNs quickly

## Install Requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

OR

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
