# Image classification using keras

In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of developing an ML model for image classification in Keras.

If you have an understanding of basic ML concepts like how neural networks and CNN works and the different layers of CNN,
This will probably a piece of cake.

Let's cut to the chase. 

# Packages

We'll be using tensorflow and keras for building our deep learning model. 

1. Tensorflow - ML library developed by google
2. Keras - It is like Python and C. Keras is a high level framework we can use to build NNs quickly

So we'll install as the pre requisites.

## Install Requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

OR

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Solve a problem

The most important thing to understand here is that you should have a clear idea of what your problem statement is.

For this tutorial, let us use the following problem statement.

```
Farming now a days are done manually. There are thousands of patents filesd every year to solve the issue of doing repeated tasks in farming.

One of the repeating tasks is, say you are building a greenhouse farm. You have to manually pluck the fruits, categorise them and 
pack them during harvesting. 

What if you can automate this task?

Let's solve this issue for a greenhouse farm having with apples and oranges.
